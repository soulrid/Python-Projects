# Python-Projects

In this project, you will be working with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products.

By conducting exploratory data analysis EDA, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.


# Dataset

Dataset contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

# Column descriptions

InvoiceNo Invoice number of the transaction
StockCode Unique code of the product
Description Description of the product
Quantity Quantity of the product in the transaction
InvoiceDate Date and time of the transaction
UnitPrice Unit price of the product
CustomerID Unique identifier of the customer
Country Country where the transaction occurred

# Requirements

1- Load the dataset - display the first 7 rows









2- Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any redundant or unnecessary columns.
3- Explore the basic statistics of the dataset.
4- Perform data visualization to gain insights into the dataset. Generate appropriate plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, or bar plots, to visualize different aspects of the data.
5- Analyze the sales trends over time. Identify the busiest months and days of the week in terms of sales.
6- Create a bar chart to visualize the total quantity of each product (StockCode) sold in the provided sample dataset? Additionally, label the x-axis with the StockCodes and provide a meaningful title and axis labels for clarity in interpretation.
7- Identify any outliers or anomalies in the dataset and discuss their potential impact on the analysis.
8- Write conclusions and summarize your findings from the exploratory data analysis.
